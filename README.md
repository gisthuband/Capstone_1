This capstone project was the creation of ski ticket price predictor, with the intent of seeing how changes features of a ski resort would impact its ticket price.

The inputs to the regression model were to be physical attributes about the ski resorts, for example, location, square footage, amount of courses, amounts of lifts, etc.

The labels were the ticket prices per ski resort.

Using ordinary least squares, the model was able to generate a ticket price for the ski resort in question based on editing its physical landscape.
